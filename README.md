# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to first use RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to resample the dataset and train a logistic regression classifier to then generate a classification report. The next deliverable was to practice our skills with using a combinatorial approach by using the SMOTEENN algorithm to resample the dataset and generate a classification report. Finally, the final deliverable is to compare the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk.
